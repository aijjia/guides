## Data Science Tools

In this section, we'll have guides to a wide variety of tools used by data scientists. Before we get to that, what exactly is _'Data Science'_?

Most companies have various definitions, roles and functions for data scientists but in general it is the science of learning from data. John Tukey prophesised that something like today's Data Science would appear. 

>" For a long time, I have thought I was a statistician, interested in inferences from the particular to the general. But as I have watched mathematical statics evolve, I have had cause to wonder and to doubt. … All in all I have come to feel that my central interest is in data analysis, which I take to include, among other things: procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data." -- **John Tukey, 1962, The Annals of Mathematical Statistics “The Future of Data Analysis”**

The 4 main aspects of data science are listed as follows:

1) Data Exploration & Cleaning
2) Data Transformation
3) Data Modelling
4) Data Visualization
